# Research Paper To-Do List

- [ ] **Conduct an Ablation Study on Supervised Learning**
  - Examine the effect of removing features on classifier discovery at different database (DB) sizes.

- [ ] **Track the Change in the Number of Epochs Needed**
  - Test with dataset sizes: 50, 500.
  - Apply to networks: ResNet50, ResNet500, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB500.

- [ ] **Perform an Ablation Study on Tiers**
  - Specifically, with small (50) and large (500) dataset sizes.

- [ ] **Implement and Test Efficiency Measures on Different Models**
  - Include considerations for post-processing steps.
  - Assess if efficiency measures impact the accuracy on different products.

- [ ] **Analyze the Behavior of Supervised Models on Plural Expression**
  - Determine the differences between singular and plural expressions in the context of image recognition.
